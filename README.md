# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

A complete Machine Learning solution for predicting Diabetes from pima diabetes dataset, deployed as a FLASK app. The model trained and used is XG boost Classifier. The ROC AUC score aquired for both the models is 0.841. 

Multiple other ML Models naming Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, SVM Classifier, SGD Classifier, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier have also been trained for the classification of diabetes task. A Notebook consisting of EDA and training of all the models is also present in the repo. As the solution is deployed as a flask app, templates folder contains a home.html and predict.html page as a front end solution.
